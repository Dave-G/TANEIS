TANEIS (There Are No Explosions in Space)

This is an old HTML5/JS game project I created back in 2013. Game plays like a typical space shooter with keyboard or touch controls.
It was mainly an opportunity to expand my game development skills while also testing new HTML5 canvas features.

There are no graphical/sound assets in this repo. It's just a re-hosting of the code.
